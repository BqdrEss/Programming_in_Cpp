1) when  we remove the using namespace std: I get the following errors:
unknown type name "string" // the compiler does not know what string is,use std::string to fix
undeclared identifier "cin" and "cout" and "endl" // cin and cout and "endl" do not exist. use std::cout and std::cin instead


2)the "name" identifier only exists inside of the Critter class. if the
    class "namespace" is not defined, the compiler does not understand that it is
    supposed to use the "name" of an instance of the Critter class. include this function
    as one of the public methods inside of the Critter class declaration to avoid this problem
